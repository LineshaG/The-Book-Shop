                <p>This is, by far, my favorite Harry Potter book. It is so spectacular and ties everything up so neatly. Things that happened in previous books finally make sense. Snape's death was the most tragic one of them all, and I loved how he gave Harry his memories and Harry used the pensieve to see Lily and Petunia's past. I really liked the description of all the battles, and there was a huge plot twist (my favorite plot twist) where Harry turns out to be a horcrux. At Fleur and Bill's wedding, Xenophilius was wearing the sign of the Deathly Hallows, which connects everything up so well, especially at the point where Harry was the Master of Death. The Epilogue was pretty good, I just felt like Harry and Hermione should've ended up together, and that it tied everything up a little too neatly. But other than that, this book was a total jewel.</p>

                </h5>
                <p>Many years ago I believed this play to be an early experiment in tragi-comedy featuring Shylock, a nemesis of almost tragic proportions, who--both because of the sympathies he evokes and the evil determination he represents--unbalances the play, making the last act in Belmont seem like a hollow exercise in formal completeness. More recently, I believed that Shylock was essentially a comic villain, one dark splash on a predominately sunny canvas that embodies f0r us the fallen world of Venice transformed by the magic of Portia's Belmont. (I also believe our knowledge of the Holocaust makes it impossible to appreciate the play fully in this way).<br> <br> Now-after my recent re-reading--I'm no longer sure what to think. For one thing--taking the title seriously this time--I feel that Antonio the merchant, both in his unexplained sadness, his love (whether erotic or paternal or both) for Bassanio, and his unredeemed solitariness, is extremely important to the meaning of the play. I think that Antonio and Shylock, in their preoccupations and loneliness, are similar, but that Antonio--unlike Shylock--is able to look beneath the surface of things, to peer beneath "our muddy vesture of decay" and hear the music of the spheres as it echoes in the human heart. Thus Antonio becomes capable of love and mercy through choice, in much the same way that Bassanio chooses the right caskets and Portia chooses the mature way to respond to Bassanio's giving away of her ring. Shylock, however, by willingly suppressing his compassion for another and insisting strictly on justice puts himself beyond mercy and beyond love.</p>

                <p>" if you love someone, let them free, if they comes back to you, they are yours" - This is what that came to my mind when I read its book cover; but it is not exactly that. The book is about Akshara, a teen who is still not over on her mother's death, a loss that was too much for her to handle. To her life, enters Harvinder(Harry) , a stranger turned friend who seemed to help her out of the pain but is he what he is showing? He shares a story of love and loss to her; a story that made her think through her pain... that sums up the book. But is there something deep to everything? Grab a copy to know more.<br>What kept me going is the emotions of the characters, the sorrow, the pain, the helplessness, doubt, confusion ... you can feel it as your own. The mystery and slight touch of humor makes it all the more, interesting. The plot is different and refreshing, it makes you wish for things on behalf of the the characters. The writing style is impressive with respect to the content he is trying to convoy.<br>I really loved the book cover design and the title, they made me feel good about the book. Other than the point that it is a bit predictable i had a great time reading it.</p>
